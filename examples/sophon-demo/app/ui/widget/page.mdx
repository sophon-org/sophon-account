# Sophon Widget

## General Usage

Once a user connects their wallet, you may want to display a navigation component to show the current wallet and connected network. Additionally, you may want to display the userâ€™s profile so they can edit their information, add additional wallets, and more.

The `SophonWidget` is the parent component that has all these features available in it. If you want to explore sub-components for more granular control, then see `SophonConnectButton`, `SophonUserProfile` and the `SophonNav` components.

If you need to embed the modal directly into your site without the need for button first, then we recommend exploring the `SophonEmbeddedWidget` instead.
