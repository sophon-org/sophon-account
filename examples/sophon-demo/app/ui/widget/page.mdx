# Sophon Widget

## General Usage

Once a user connects their wallet, you may want to display a navigation component to show the current wallet and connected network. Additionally, you may want to display the userâ€™s profile so they can edit their information, add additional wallets, and more.

The `SophonWidget` is the parent component that has all these features available in it. If you want to explore sub-components for more granular control, then see `SophonConnectButton`, `SophonUserProfile` and the `SophonNav` components.

If you need to embed the modal directly into your site without the need for button first, then we recommend exploring the `SophonEmbeddedWidget` instead.

## Properties

<ComponentPropertyTable
  componentClass={SophonWidget}
  properties={[
    {
      name: "variant",
      type: "'modal' | 'dropdown'",
      description: "The variant name of the widget",
    },
    {
      name: "label",
      type: "ReactNode",
      description:
        "The label of the widget, if not provided, the default label will be used",
    },
    {
      name: "className",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The CSS class name of the widget, it must exists in the shadow DOM",
    },
    {
      name: "containerClassName",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The CSS class name of the widget container, it must exists in the shadow DOM",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Widget With Modal

This is the default expecience, once clicked the widget will open the login or profile page on a modal in the center of the screen.

<ExampleWithCode
  code={[
    {
      language: "tsx",
      fileName: "WidgetWithModal.tsx",
      code: await getFileContent("ui/sophon-widget/WidgetWithModal.tsx"),
    },
  ]}
>
  <WidgetWithModal />
</ExampleWithCode>

## Custom Widget

You can also customize the widget to your needs, but because we use `ShadowDom` for ui isolation, you need to override the css in the provider. This is useful if you want to match the design of your site.
Out of the box, you can use the `partner-custom-button` class to override the styles of the button.

<ExampleWithCode
  code={[
    {
      language: "tsx",
      fileName: "WidgetCustom.tsx",
      code: await getFileContent("ui/sophon-widget/WidgetCustom.tsx"),
    }
  ]}
>

  <WidgetCustom />
</ExampleWithCode>
