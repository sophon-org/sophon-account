# Rate Limits

Sophon Account SDK currently inherits its rate limits from the Dynamic rate limits. For detailed information on the rate limits implemented by Dynamic, please refer to their [Rate Limits Overview](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/developer-dashboard/rate-limits).

Until our own API system is in place, the rate limits defined by Dynamic will apply to all requests made through the Sophon Account SDK. This ensures that your applications adhere to the same usage policies and limitations as those set by Dynamic, providing a consistent and reliable experience.
