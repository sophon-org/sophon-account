## Technical Questions

### How do I handle wallet connection errors?

You can use the `onError` callback in the `SophonWidget` or `SophonConnectButton` components to handle connection errors:

```tsx
<SophonWidget
  onError={(error) => {
    console.error("Connection error:", error);
    // Handle the error appropriately
  }}
/>
```

### Can I customize the UI components?

Yes, all UI components can be customized using CSS classes and theme properties. See the [UI Components](/ui/overview) documentation for more details.

### How do I switch between chains?

You can use the `SophonWidgetNav` component which includes a network picker, or implement your own chain switching logic using the `useChain` hook:

```tsx
import { useChain } from "@sophon-labs/react";

function ChainSwitcher() {
  const { chain, switchChain } = useChain();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => switchChain("sophon")}>Switch to Sophon</button>
  );
}
```
