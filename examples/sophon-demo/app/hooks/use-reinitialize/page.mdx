# useReinitialize

Used to manually reinitialize the whole SDK at any point in time. It will reset not just the user state (as `useRefreshUser` does), but the whole SDK state including wallets, the `primaryWallet`, user state, etc.

An example of where this hook can be helpful is if you have multiple seperate windows (things like a Chrome extension popup and a Chrome page for the same extension) where Sophon is active and you want to ensure they are all in sync.

While in process, the `sdkHasLoaded` boolean on `useSophonContext` will be false, and once completed, it will be true.
