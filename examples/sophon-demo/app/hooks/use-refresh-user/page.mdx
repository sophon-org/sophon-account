# useRefreshUser

Used to manually refresh the user state at any point in time, for example if you have multiple seperate windows (things like a Chrome extension popup and a Chrome page for the same extension) where Sophon is active and you want to ensure they are all in sync.

The SDK state as a whole will be maintained i.e. the `sdkHasLoaded` boolean on `useSophonContext` will stay true. If you want to reset the whole SDK including wallets, then take a look at `useReinitialize`.
