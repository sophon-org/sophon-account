# Overview of Sophon Hooks

This document provides an overview of the various hooks available in the Sophon SDK. These hooks are designed to help manage user authentication, SDK state, and wallet interactions within your application.

## Hooks

### useIsLoggedIn

Determines whether a user is logged in. It checks for the existence of a user object or a primary wallet when the auth mode is 'connect-only'.

### useSophonContext

Provides access to Sophon's React Context, containing information about the current user and SDK state.

### useReinitialize

Allows manual reinitialization of the entire SDK, resetting user state, wallets, and more.

### useRefreshUser

Enables manual refreshing of the user state while maintaining the overall SDK state.

Each hook is designed to be used within a child of `SophonContextProvider` to ensure proper context and state management.
