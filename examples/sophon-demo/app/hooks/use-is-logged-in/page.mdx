# useIsLoggedIn

This hook determines whether a user is logged in or not. The hook needs to be initialized within a child of `SophonContextProvider`.

The hook first checks if the user object exists or if the authMode is 'connect-only' and a primaryWallet exists. If either of these conditions is true, the user is considered logged in.

Next, it checks the user should have a primaryWallet due to embedded wallets being enabled. If the user should have a promaryWallet and it doesn't exist, the user is not considered logged in, otherwise, they are considered logged in.
