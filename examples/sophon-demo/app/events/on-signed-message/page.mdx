# onSignedMessage

This callback will be called after a user has signed a message, and it allows you to act on that message.

## Usage

```tsx
<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      onSignedMessage: ({ signatureHash, signedMessage }) => {
        console.log(
          `onSignedMessage was called: ${signatureHash}, ${signedMessage}`,
        );
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* ... rest of your app ... */}
</SophonContextProvider>
```
