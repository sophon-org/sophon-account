# Sophon Account Events

## Sophon Events

An alternative to using event callbacks or useDynamicEvents react hook is to use dynamicEvents emitter directly.

```tsx
sophonEvents.on(eventName, listener);
```

## Events Callback

You do not need to import anything extra to make use of event callbacks, instead simply add them using the events field inside the settings prop on `SophonContextProvider`.

If you are looking for synchronous actions that will block the user until completion, please look at Handlers

```tsx
<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      // events callbacks go here
    },
  }}
>
  ...
</SophonContextProvider4>
```

These are the available callbacks:

`onAuthFlowCancel`: Called when the auth modal is closed before authentication is successful (alongside onAuthFlowClose).

`onAuthFlowClose`: Called whenever the auth flow modal is closed.

`onAuthFlowOpen`: Called after the auth flow modal is opened.

`onAuthFailure`: Called when authentication fails.

`onAuthInit`: Called when an authentication process begins.

`onAuthSuccess`: Called after the user successfully authenticates.

`onEmbeddedWalletCreated`: Called after embedded wallet created for user.

`onLogout`: Called after the user logs out.

`onOtpVerificationResult`: Called when an email or SMS OTP verification succeeds or fails.

`onSignedMessage`: Called when the user signs a message and it allows you to act on that message.

`onUserProfileUpdate`: Called when the user successfully updated their profile.

`onWalletAdded`: Called when a new wallet is added to the user wallets.

`onWalletRemoved`: Called when a wallet is removed from the user wallets.

`onWalletTabSelected`: Called when a wallet tab is selected by the user.
