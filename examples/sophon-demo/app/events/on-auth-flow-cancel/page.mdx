# onAuthFlowCancel

This callback will be called when the auth modal is closed before authentication is successful. Note that onAuthFlowClose will also still be called â€” if you want an event that is fired whenever the auth modal is closed, you should listen to it.

## Usage

```tsx
<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      onAuthFlowCancel: () => {
        console.log("Authentication was cancelled");
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* ... rest of your app ... */}
</SophonContextProvider>
```
