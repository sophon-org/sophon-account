# onAuthFailure

This callback will be called when an authentication process fails.

This can be either caused by an error or by the user cancelling the process.

<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      onAuthFailure: (method, reason) => {
        console.log("onAuthFailure was called", method, reason);
      },
    },
  }}
