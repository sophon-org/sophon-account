# Sophon Events

An alternative to using event callbacks or `useSophonEvents` react hook is to use sophonEvents emitter directly.

It can used anywhere, even outside of a React component.

If you want to listen to events in a React component, you might want to use the `useSophonEvents` hook instead, as it will automatically unsubscribe when the component is unmounted.

## Usage

```tsx
import { sophonEvents } from "@sophon-labs/react";

sophonEvents.on("primaryWalletChanged", (newPrimaryWallet) => {
  console.log("primaryWalletChanged was called", newPrimaryWallet);
});

sophonEvents.on("primaryWalletNetworkChanged", (newNetwork) => {
  console.log("primaryWalletNetworkChanged was called", newNetwork);
});

sophonEvents.on("userWalletsChanged", (params) => {
  console.log("userWalletsChanged was called", params);
});
```
