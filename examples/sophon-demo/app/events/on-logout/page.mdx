# onLogout

This callback will be called after the user logs out.

It will be called either when the user explicitly logged out by calling `handleLogOut` or when the user's token expired.

## Usage

```tsx
<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      onLogout: (args) => {
        console.log("onLogout was called", args);
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* ... rest of your app ... */}
</SophonContextProvider>
```
