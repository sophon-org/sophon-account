# onAuthInit

This callback will be called when an authentication process initiates.

For wallets, this is when signature is requested.
For email and SMS, this is as soon as user provides the phone number or email address.
For social, this is as soon as user selects a social provider.

## Usage

```tsx
<SophonContextProvider
  settings={{
    events: {
      onAuthInit: (args) => {
        console.log("onAuthInit was called", args);
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* ... rest of your app ... */}
</SophonContextProvider>
```
